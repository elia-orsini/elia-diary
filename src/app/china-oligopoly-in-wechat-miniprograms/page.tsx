        China&apos;s Oligopoly in the world of WeChat Miniprograms
      </h1>

      <p className="texl text-xl">
        If you&apos;ve ever been to china you might be wondering how, whether ordering for coffee,
        lunch or a quick snack from completely different places, every Wechat Miniprogram just feels
        so familiar. The reason behind this strange familiarity happens to be motivated by an
        effective oligopoly of businesses controlling the entire field of{" "}
        <i>Wechat Miniprogram Development</i>. This effective oligopoly seems to be mostly formed by
        Youzan and Flipos. This might not seem very surprising as every industry in tech seems to
        have small amounts of companies controlling big shares of the market (see internet browsers,
        social networks, delivery apps).
        <br />
        <br />
        This is therefore certainly not new. However, there is a big distinction between the two
        phenomenons I have just mentioned. The most apparent of which is that while for internet
        browsers or social networks each major player is a consumer-facing brand with its own design
        philosophy, colour palette and typography, when it comes to the oligopoly of companies
        developing wechat miniprograms,{" "}
        <b>these are not brands consumers typically see or even care about</b>. These big players,
        instead, are in charge of developing consumer-facing online stores for thousands of brands
        in every major consumer sector. What results from this is just a monotomy of layouts and
        design choices which becomes repetitive and familiar. With this, every brand starts looking
        more and more like their competitors until it&apos;s hard to distinguish which one is which.
        <br />
        <br />
        All this can seem like a positive aspect overall. I mean if you think about it, a user
        interface that looks very similar between brands makes it really easy for users to use and
        interact with. And that&apos;s a really good point. Usability is definitely a very important
        factor when it comes to consumer facing services, especially the ones we use every single
        day. However, while we might be gaining a lot in terms of usability, we are losing so much
        in terms of aesthetic differences which ultimately makes us love our favourite restaurant,
        bar, caf√©, art gallery.
        <br />
        <br />
        To better understand this, we can just take a look at a few examples of restaurant menus{" "}

        These few restaurants menus I think give a really good idea of how different a one page menu
        can look like if you don&apos;t follow a strict template. The amount of possibilities when
        it comes to the layout, the philosophy, the vibe you want to convey is just absolutely
        endless. And I think even tho it&apos;s very different, it <i>usually</i> remains easy to
        interpret for the people dining at that place.
        <br />
        <br />
        And now we can compare this variety of aesthetics with three examples of WeChat Miniprograms
        of three distrinct cafes/bakeries:

        This is a very clear example of what&apos;s happening. However, I also need to admit that
        it&apos;s not like this all the time. If anything, most times the Wechat Miniprograms look
        different. Are they <i>different enough</i>? Not sure about that. Granted it&apos;s a subtle
        distinction but one still worth making in my opinion.

        Don&apos;t get me wrong. The Wechat Miniprograms developers are doing an amazing job at
        trying to differentiate between the various brands using the same services. But I think
        it&apos;s just not enough to make the user get attached to a completely <i>unique</i> UI
        that brands could have. This is really easy to notice when interacting with most websites on
        the web. See here:

        The curious thing is that even though most websites might use templates, they remain
        idiosyncratic enough to express what their brand is about. Some websites might not be
